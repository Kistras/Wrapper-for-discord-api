# Wrapper-for-discord-api
This is, as it was said, wrapper for discord api. Wrapper for a wrapper, yeah. You can check this one here -> https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py.
I made it to make it easier to manage, contribute and edit my own bots so it was created in utterly unpythonic way.
The main idea is that you can create any amount of modules in '/modules' folder and all of them would work (well, not really, but whatever). You can see an example of how it works in, well, '/modules' folder.

# Don't forget to change your token in config.py

Commentary isn't helpful, but I left some examples so you can try to figure everything out by yourself.
Good luck, have fun.
